//! P2P endpoint for saorsa-transport
//!
//! This module provides the main API for P2P communication with NAT traversal,
//! secure connections, and event-driven architecture.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Configuration via [`P2pConfig`](crate::unified_config::P2pConfig)
//! - Event subscription via broadcast channels
//! - TLS-based peer authentication via ML-DSA-65 (v0.2+)
//! - NAT traversal with automatic fallback
//! - Connection metrics and statistics
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use saorsa_transport::{P2pEndpoint, P2pConfig};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!     // All nodes are symmetric - they can both connect and accept connections
//!     let config = P2pConfig::builder()
//!         .bind_addr("0.0.0.0:9000".parse()?)
//!         .known_peer("quic.saorsalabs.com:9000".parse()?)
//!         .build()?;
//!
//!     let endpoint = P2pEndpoint::new(config).await?;
//!     println!("Public key: {:?}", endpoint.local_public_key());
//!
//!     // Subscribe to events
//!     let mut events = endpoint.subscribe();
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
//!             println!("Event: {:?}", event);
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     // Connect to known peers
//!     endpoint.connect_known_peers().await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
