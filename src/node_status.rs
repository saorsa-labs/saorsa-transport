//! Consolidated node status for observability
//!
//! This module provides [`NodeStatus`] - a single snapshot of everything
//! about a node's current state, including NAT type, connectivity,
//! relay status, and performance metrics.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use saorsa_transport::Node;
//!
//! let node = Node::new().await?;
//! let status = node.status();
//!
//! println!("NAT type: {:?}", status.nat_type);
//! println!("Can receive direct: {}", status.can_receive_direct);
//! println!("Acting as relay: {}", status.is_relaying);
//! println!("Relay sessions: {}", status.relay_sessions);
//! ```
