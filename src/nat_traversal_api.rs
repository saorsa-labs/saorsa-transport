//! High-level NAT Traversal API for Autonomi P2P Networks

//! QUIC connections through NATs using sophisticated hole punching and
//! coordination protocols.

/// Creates a bind address that allows the OS to select a random available port
///
/// This provides protocol obfuscation by preventing port fingerprinting, which improves
/// security by making it harder for attackers to identify and target QUIC endpoints.
///
/// # Security Benefits
/// - **Port Randomization**: Each endpoint gets a different random port, preventing easy detection
/// - **Fingerprinting Resistance**: Makes protocol identification more difficult for attackers
/// - **Attack Surface Reduction**: Reduces predictable network patterns that could be exploited
///
/// # Implementation Details
/// - Binds to `0.0.0.0:0` to let the OS choose an available port
/// - Used automatically when `bind_addr` is `None` in endpoint configuration
/// - Provides better security than static or predictable port assignments
///
/// # Added in Version 0.6.1
/// This function was introduced as part of security improvements in commit 6e633cd9
/// to enhance protocol obfuscation capabilities.
